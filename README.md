# WeighingScale
Its an Arduino Project. I am building a weigh scale using Arduino atmega2560, hx711 amplifier and MCUFriend screen. Still thinking of how to incorporate a bluetooth module.

Well, I have managed to decide on how to use the bluetooth module. I have used the module to send data to my android phone which the transmits the data to firebase for storage(Real-Time Database).
 I made changes, I am using the LCD module with I2C in place of MCUFriend. 
 I used App inventor to make my Android App (LoadBlue Control).
